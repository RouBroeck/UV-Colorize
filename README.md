# UV-Colorize
This Blender addon is for those who want to develop a low-poly model for games. The models are not determined by different materials, vertex or texture painting, but by a single material containing the png-colorpalette and the shifting of the UVs to the respective colors. Attention! The UVs are scaled to zero, so some programs might have problems with lightbaking.
